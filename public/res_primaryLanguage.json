I have developed web pages using HTML5, CSS, Javascrtipt, ReactJS, Angular, Vue.js and Bootstrap for five years as a hobby.  Now I want to pursue full stack development as a fulltime career. I also have experience with the WAMP, MAMP and LAMP stack which I use to develop Wordpress sites.  I do know some PHP and I am always willing to build new skills.",
